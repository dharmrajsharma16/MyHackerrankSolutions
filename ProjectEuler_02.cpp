/*
Project Euler #2: Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,â‹¯
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed N, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
